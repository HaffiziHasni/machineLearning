This project essentially predicts whether or not a definition in the urban dictionary to be misogynist or not. The ML follows a random forest classifier (RFC) model approach with an accuracy score of 98.69% on the training data set and 87.11% on the test data set.

Initially a decision tree classifier was used as the prediction score on the train data sets was 99.89% however since the accuracy was 86.68% on the test data sets, RFC was chosen.

The finalized model was tested against testdata and it was 100% accurate although the unseen data has only 3 texts.
